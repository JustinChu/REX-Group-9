Convert mafft file to phylip file (*.phy)

I use the perl script from http://www.mbari.org/staff/haddock/scripts/
The first script on the website: [encodename.pl]

run “perl encodename.pl [mfft file name]”

I use the default setting here. The script will rename the longer name to shorter name for each individual and give us a dictionary file (*.lut) for reference.

It seems that we can convert the shorter name back to the longer name by this script: [decodename.pl]
but I haven’t tried it. Sorry….

Construction of phylogenetic tree

I use RAxML to construct phylogenetic tree: http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html

raxmlHPC -m GTRGAMMA -p 1225 -s [phy file name] -# 20 -n [output name]

-m type of parsimony: I use GTRGAMMA. This is also the parsimony used by the Ebola paper on Science.
-p random number seed: I use 1225 (my birthday...), you can use whatever you want. Just be consistent.
-s read which file
-# replication: I used 5 when I tested it. The Ebola paper on Science used 15 replications. The program will choose one of the best result from these 5 or 15 replications.
-n the name of the output file

The result can be read by Dendroscope.
